# kidOYO
Collection of projects I created while learning to code.

From 9th-12th grade, I learned how to code in Python and Java mainly through kidOYO's OYOclass platform. Below is a website I created in high school to show off some projects:

While these projects aren't too impressive, it is nice to see how far I've come since I began coding!

Unfortunately, I cannot put the source code on a public repo as I do not want to give out complete solutions to OYOclass challenges.
