# kidOYO
Collection of projects I created while learning to code.

From 9th-12th grade, I learned how to code in Python and Java mainly through kidOYO's OYOclass platform. While these projects aren't too impressive, it is nice to see how far I've come since I began coding! Unfortunately, I cannot put the source code on a public repo as I do not want to give out complete solutions to OYOclass challenges.

Below is a website I created in high school to show off these projects:

Below are my most impressive projects on the site. They were all made using Python 2 and the Processing library.
